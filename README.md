# Portfolio
Below is a summary of this portfolio. 

The "Portfolio.ppt" is a brief highlight of some of the projects I have worked on. There are some examples of blueprints I have written, as well as the link to a Global Game Jam project we completed in 2019. However, Non-Disclosure Agreements prevent from showing in-depth work on these projects.

The "Projectiles" file is a snippet from a game I wrote in 2012-2013 in C#. The file is how to fire projectiles in an isometric space and cycles through 2D animations.

Also, check out the VHUB repository for examples of some Java code from my team's capstone project and check out our presentation video at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axDyhF1N7hY
