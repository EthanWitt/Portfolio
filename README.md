# Portfolio
Below is a summary of this portfolio. 

The "Portfolio.ppt" is a brief highlight of some of the projects I have worked on. There are some examples of blueprints I have written, as well as the link to a Global Game Jam project we completed in 2019. However, Non-Disclosure Agreements prevent from showing in-depth work on these projects.

"Substring Analysis" came from an exercise I was doing where a person wanting to write a note by cutting out words in a magazine. The function takes the parsed magazine and compares it to what the note needs to say and returns a boolean. The catch is, if a word only occurs once in the magazine, it can only be used once in the note, otherwise the result will return false.

The "Projectiles" file is a snippet from a game I wrote in C#. The file is how to fire projectiles in an isometric space and cycles through 2D animations.

"Battleships.cpp" is a portion of a C++ project to play Battleship in a console window.

"Tree.h" is a snippet of a C++ database program I wrote to handle user data.
