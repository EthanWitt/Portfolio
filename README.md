Below are some snippets of code of projects I have completed. Also, check out my capstone project at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axDyhF1N7hY

The "Projectiles" file is a snippet from a small game I wrote in college.

"Pulse" is a new project I am creating that will implement the use of a heartbeat sensor into a VR system to adjust the reticle of a firearm based on the wearer's heartbeat. The higher the heartrate, the more the reticle will expand and it will wander a bit. Another variant I plan on making will adjust the sight picture when the player looks down the sights or an optic of a weapon.
